        longDesc: "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is poised to cross $1 billion worldwide soon, but its gross still trails that of The Last Jedi. While it remains a strong accomplishment, earning $1 billion globally is far more common these days that it was just a decade ago. At the turn of the 2010s, only seven movies in history made that much, and now - with Frozen II recently reaching that mark - the number has risen all the way up to 45. At this point, if a major studio tentpole doesn't hit $1 billion during its run, it's considered a disappointment. Fortunately for Disney, they seem to have no problem selling that many tickets. The Mouse House's renaissance of the Star Wars franchise certainly contributed to the sizable uptick in $1 billion films. To date, three of them have grossed that much, with 2018's Solo: A Star Wars Story the lone outlier. Though The Rise of Skywalker posted the lowest opening weekend of the sequel trilogy, it's still found a great deal of commercial success, being the #1 movie in the world for the past two weeks. Many expected The Rise of Skywalker to be another $1 billion earner for Disney, and it's well on its way to doing just that. Per The Wrap, The Rise of Skywalker is expected to surpass $900 million worldwide this weekend, meaning it's only a matter of time before it hits $1 billion. However, The Rise of Skywalker is more than likely going to finish with a total below The Last Jedi's $1.3 billion, so the trilogy finale's box office performance is something of a mixed bag."
